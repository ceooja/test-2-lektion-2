oh ther once was a hero named ragnar the red
who came riding to whitrun from old roriksted
and the hero did bragger and brandish is blade
as he told of bold battles and gold he had made

but then he went quiet did ragnar the red 
as he meet the shiled maiden mathilda who said
"oh you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead
now i think it's high time that you lie down and bleed
